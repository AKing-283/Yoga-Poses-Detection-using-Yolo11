# Yoga-Poses-Detection-using-Yolo11 üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§ñ

# ‚ú® Overview
This project demonstrates the use of YOLOv11 (You Only Look Once version 11) for detecting and classifying yoga poses in real-time. YOLOv11, a state-of-the-art object detection model, is fine-tuned on a custom dataset of yoga poses to recognize various yoga positions accurately. The application can detect poses from images or video streams, providing valuable insights for users practicing yoga.

# üåü Features:
* Real-time detection of multiple yoga poses from images or video feeds.
* High accuracy and fast performance using YOLOv11.
* Supports a variety of yoga poses including Downward Dog, Tree Pose, Warrior Pose, etc.

# üîß Technologies:
This project uses a combination of cutting-edge technologies to ensure fast and reliable pose detection:
* Object Detection: YOLOv11 (pretrained model fine-tuned on custom dataset).
* Python Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.
* Dataset: Custom dataset of yoga poses (can be augmented for better accuracy).
* Environment: Python scripts.


# Disclaimer #
* The dataset is of limited yoga poses so it might provide inaccurate output in video feed
